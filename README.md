## My own website
This is it, I have **my own website** on the web !  
• [max-mb.com](https://max-mb.com/) is my personnal website where I share my works, contacts infos and even a short auto-biography.  
It has two purposes: having a continuous and important project, and having everything about me all grouped in the same place for people that wants to learn more about me.  
  
The website features **three main parts**:
- **About me**: A section about me with my skills such as what programming languages do I know or what software can I use, my formations (diplomas and certifications) and profesionnal experiences. I also wrote an autobiography but honestly its purpose isn't to be read at all, it was just an excuse for me to have another page to write, design and program.
- **Works**: Showcases all my projects and artworks with a short description for all of them. This part is more for people interested in my works but also is very interesting to me because it gives me a space where all my important works are grouped. I plan also having a page with some sort of sort like chronological or sorted by languages.
- **Contacts**: It's like the port-salut it's écrit dessus. Simply gives my socials and contact informations to anyone that would want to get in contact with me. Can be profesionnal throught LinkedIn or gmail, or less serious on Instagram, I'm opened to talk to anyone that finds interests in me or my works.  

## The project
I program this website **alone**, from **start to finish**.  
I don't have anyone working with me *(except if we count the ten years old questions and answers on stackoverflow as contribution which wouldn't be robbed tho)*.  

And when I say I do all myself, **I mean it**.  
I am currently renting a Unix VPS to host myself the website. So I had to configure the Apache virtual host and the SSL certificate by hand in this dark thing that programmers looks to like; the powershell.  

I firstly made the git only to have the project on my two computers, but now it serves also as a visual representation of my work and improvement across the weeks and months.  
I program this website only using HTML, pure CSS and JavaScript. I really do my best to keep it simple but yet professionnal.  
One of my main focus is responsivity, I am trying to have a great result no matter the device it's been viewed on.

The website is online at this link: https://max-mb.com/.  
I'm pretty proud of it, if you have any suggestions or comments, write me and I'll see what I can do.  
I am thinking about implementing a comment system directly on the website, but that's maybe for another time.
